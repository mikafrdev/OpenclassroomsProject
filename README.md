# LLNL Contributors

This is a small project to use a subset of data from [the LLNL open source site](https://llnl.github.io/)
combined with running [this contributors analyis tool]() to quickly answer:

 - What is the breakdown of interal vs. external contributors for each repository.
 - Within a repository, where do our contributors come from?
 - Which repositories have opportunity to improve documentation and engagement?
 
If we can pair this with a primary purpose of each repository, we might be able
to say "This tool has a strong use case for the external community but doesn't
seem to be well known."
